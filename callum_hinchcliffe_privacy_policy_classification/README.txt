# Classifying Practices in Privacy Policy Text

This project seeks to identify data practices described by app developers in their data privacy policy.  Using natural language processing and machine learning, can we summarise key information found in a privacy policy?

This project looks at work done by UsablePrivacy.org in using machine learning to extract information from privacy policies, specifically described in this paper: Story et al. 2019, available here: https://usableprivacy.org/static/files/story_pal_2019.pdf

The dataset can be downloaded from this link https://usableprivacy.org/static/data/MAPS_Policies_Dataset_v1.0.zip

The python Jupyter Notebooks in order are:
1. Loading and Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Baseline_model
4. Preprocessing
5. Modelling pipeline

The other folders and files include:
1. Executive Report
2. Data folder containing the source data
3. Objects folder that can be used to load cleaned data
4. python_environment.txt for loading the python environment used for the notebooks
5. priv_pol_funcs - a python script with functions for manipulating the data
