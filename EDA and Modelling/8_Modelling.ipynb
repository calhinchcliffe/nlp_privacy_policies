Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes the cookie. As part of BlackBerry\\'s Offerings, BlackBerry may use different types of cookies or similar technologies (\"Cookies\") from time to time. Certain Cookies are necessary to facilitate your use of BlackBerry Offerings (such as when you use a shopping basket) or to protect both you and BlackBerry when you sign-in to certain services (such as storing your credentials to make it easier whenever you want to use BlackBerry Offerings or to confirm that you are logged in). Other Cookies are more performance-related such as for analytics or contextual purposes to help us understand how users engage with BlackBerry Offerings so we can provide new and enhanced BlackBerry Offerings (such as which pages or features are most popular). Some Cookies are more function-related and help personalize your experience and make BlackBerry Offerings easier to use (such as your language or jurisdiction preferences), or to help BlackBerry display personalized content to you. Other Cookies or similar technologies may be used for targeted advertising purposes (e.g. certain BlackBerry Offerings may be supported by advertising revenue and display advertisements and promotions which may be targeted against non-personally identifiable attributes or aggregate data collected by BlackBerry, and BlackBerry or our service providers may place such advertising on BlackBerry Offerings). Anonymized or aggregated information about usage of BlackBerry Offerings may be provided in a form that does not personally identify you to our service providers as part of analytics services and to help manage online advertising. Most browsers are initially set to accept Cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to refuse Cookies or to indicate when a Cookie is being sent. You can typically remove or block browser Cookies using the settings in your browser, but that may impact your ability to use certain BlackBerry Offerings as they may not work well or at all with Cookies disabled.

If BlackBerry collects and subsequently stores such information, it will be in a form that does not personally identify you (e.g. BlackBerry does not maintain a system that would link specific individuals to a BSSID). BlackBerry may process such information to provide you with or facilitate the provision of information and location-based services (e.g. mapping services, measuring traffic congestion, location-sensitive promotions or coupons). If you choose to use location-based services, you agree that such geographic location information may be processed to provide you with such services. You may manage through the settings on your device either the overall settings for your device's GPS or location functionality or individual settings for each application. If you choose to use location-based services or other applications to disclose your location to other persons or entities, you assume responsibility for the risks involved in doing so, and it is your responsibility to use them appropriately and according to applicable law.

For example, BlackBerry may receive personal information about you from third parties involved in providing you with the products, services, software and websites you are utilizing, such as from your airtime service provider to facilitate the wireless services you are utilizing or in some cases from a Third Party Offering vendor regarding applications used on your device. BlackBerry treats all such personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the terms and conditions between BlackBerry and such third parties, if any, may also apply.

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area or a country which restricts data transfers outside of that jurisdiction or region without your consent, you consent to your personal information being transferred outside of the European Economic Area or your country for processing or storage by or on behalf of BlackBerry.',\n",

For example, we may do so where you have not unsubscribed from receiving such communications and it is permitted by law, where you have explicitly agreed to receive such communications, where you use free services which rely upon advertising (including targeted advertising based on profile information), or through utilizing aggregated data or data that has been made anonymous. BlackBerry may ask you from time to time if you would like to receive from BlackBerry or authorized third parties selected by BlackBerry additional announcements, news, offers or event invitations regarding BlackBerry and BlackBerry Offerings. You may also choose to provide BlackBerry with information in response to various BlackBerry promotions. If you agree to participate in contests, surveys, giveaways, reviews, or other promotions that BlackBerry sponsors or co-sponsors, please ensure that you read the Notice that may be associated with these initiatives in order to obtain further details about how your personal information will be managed. Typically, an unsubscribe mechanism is included with every BlackBerry marketing or commercial communication. Please visit the section below on \"Managing your preferences\" for more information on managing marketing or commercial communications from BlackBerry.',\n",
       " 'd) Service-related communications from BlackBerry BlackBerry may also send you certain service-related communications. For example, BlackBerry may send a welcome email or message when you first register your device to inform you about the service and its terms, to notify you of important changes, to tell you how to manage your credentials or account, to provide service infrastructure notifications or information about upgrades or updates, to provide warranty information, product recall information, safety or security information, or for surveys of current or former users. Because such service-related communications are important to your use of BlackBerry Offerings, you may not opt-out of receiving these communications.',\n",

When you download or utilize Third Party Offerings, personal information from your device or other BlackBerry Offerings may be accessed by such third parties. For example, a Third Party Offering might access on-device data such as contacts, calendar entries, email, location-based information, or it may access or share files or data stored on the device (including with additional Third Party Offerings). You should review the privacy policies and any agreements with such third parties to understand how your personal information will be treated by those entities, as BlackBerry is not responsible for your dealings with third parties or their applications, products, services or software.

Safeguarding your personal information BlackBerry continues to evolve our physical, organizational and technological measures used to protect your personal information against loss or theft, unauthorized access, alteration or disclosure appropriate to its level of sensitivity. For example, if a BlackBerry website requests your name and password, it will have a variety of security measures in place that are designed to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration of the personal information submitted to BlackBerry. Through BlackBerry's Code of Business Standards and Principles, BlackBerry employees are made aware of the importance of appropriately and securely handling personal information, to keep it in secure locations and systems, and to limit access to personal information to those with a need to know it for business reasons.\",\n",

You should also disassociate your device from all email accounts and other data services so that email and data are no longer directed to the device (e.g. push services, emails delivered through the BlackBerry Internet Service, remote backup). Otherwise, your personal information may be available to a subsequent user of the device, and you may incur subscription and network data charges.
